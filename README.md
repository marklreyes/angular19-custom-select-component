![Reactive Form and Custom Component to illustrate a select menu with options](https://github.com/marklreyes/angular19-custom-select-component/blob/main/Angular19_ReactiveFormOptions_CustomSelectOptions.gif?raw=true)


## Features
- Standard dropdown menu with Angular Reactive Forms
- Custom select component with Material Design-like styling
- Accessibility support (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design
- Animations for dropdown interactions

## Behind The Screen
- `AppComponent`
	- Deferrable views with `@defer`, `@loading`, `@error` and `@placeholder` blocks.
	- `OptionsService` to **fake** a backend call with the newer DI method with `inject()`. No need for instantiation inside of a class constructor, wow!
- `OptionsMenuComponent`
	- Reactive Form including Material-like Design *without* the actual use of Angular Material UI.
	- `@Input`, `@Output` decorators to establish parent-to-child relationship and project selected data back to `AppComponent`.
	- FYI - select > option HTML elements are limited on custom styling, thus the creation of `CustomSelectComponent`.
- `CustomSelectComponent`
	- Custom Select Form including Material-like Design *without* the actual use of Angular Material UI.
	- `@Input`, `@Output` decorators to establish parent-to-child relationship and project selected data back to `AppComponent`.
	- `ControlValueAccessor` interface to allow custom component to be used as a Form Control.
	- `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` token to provide aforementioned interface for form controls.
